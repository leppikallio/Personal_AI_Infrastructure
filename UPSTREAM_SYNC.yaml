  notes: |
    Synced images and doc improvements.
    Kept our custom settings.json and setup.sh.

# Files we deliberately keep different from upstream
# DO NOT overwrite these during sync
customized_files:
  - path: .claude/settings.json
    reason: Contains our personalized config (Marvin, API keys, custom skills)

  - path: .claude/setup.sh
    reason: Points to our fork, has our defaults (Marvin vs Kai)

  - path: README.md
    reason: Partial sync - take version badge but keep our repo URLs

# Files/directories we add that upstream doesn't have
our_additions:
  - .claude/skills/Photorealistic/
  - .claude/commands/photo-*.md
  - .claude/commands/art-*.md
  - .claude/skills/Art/get-art-config.ts
  - package.json
  - tsconfig.json
  - UPSTREAM_SYNC.yaml

# What to cherry-pick from upstream (docs/images mostly)
sync_targets:
  always_sync:
    - docs/images/*.png
    - docs/QUICKSTART.md

  selective_sync:
    - path: README.md
      take: version badge, new images
      skip: repo URLs, setup commands

# Quick sync command reference
commands:
  fetch: git fetch upstream
  compare: git log main..upstream/main --oneline
  diff_file: git diff main upstream/main -- <file>
  checkout_file: git checkout upstream/main -- <file>
