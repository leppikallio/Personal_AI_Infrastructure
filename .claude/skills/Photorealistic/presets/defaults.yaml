# Photorealistic Workflow - Golden Config
# These settings are research-validated for FLUX models (late 2025)
# DO NOT modify unless you understand the implications

# Default model
model: flux-pro  # Options: flux-pro, flux-dev, flux-schnell

# Core generation parameters
generation:
  guidance: 3.5      # CFG scale - FLUX sweet spot (NOT 7-12 like old SD)
  steps: 28          # For flux-pro (20 for flux-dev, 1-4 for schnell)
  sampler: dpmpp_2m  # Optimal sampler for FLUX
  scheduler: sgm_uniform

# Phase-specific overrides
phases:
  composition:
    steps: 20        # Faster iteration
    guidance: 3.5
    batch: 4         # Default options to generate

  refine:
    steps: 28
    guidance: 3.5
    strength: 0.35   # Preserve composition (0.25-0.45 range)

  detail:
    steps: 30
    strength: 0.5    # Allow meaningful change in masked area

  upscale:
    steps: 30
    strength: 0.2    # Minimal change, just resolution

# Output settings
output:
  format: png
  quality: 95
  resolution: 1024x1024  # Start size, upscale in final step

# Seed logging
seed:
  log: true          # Always log seeds
  format: "Seed: {seed} (use --seed {seed} to reproduce)"

# Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
checkpoints:
  composition: true  # Must approve before refinement
  refine: true       # Must approve before detail
  detail: true       # Must approve before upscale
  auto_advance: false  # NEVER auto-advance phases
